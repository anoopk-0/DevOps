# Kubernetes controllers

Controllers are crucial components in Kubernetes that manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes objects, ensuring they are maintained as desired.

controllers: `Replication Controller` and `ReplicaSet`.

## Understanding Replication Controllers

Imagine you have a single pod running your application. If this pod were to fail due to any reason, your users would lose access to the application.

To prevent such downtime, we use a Replication Controller to maintain multiple instances (replicas) of the same pod.

---

Why Replication Controllers?

- `High Availability`: By running multiple replicas of a pod, the Replication Controller ensures that even if one replica fails, others continue serving traffic.
  
- `Load Balancing`: As demand increases, additional pods are deployed to share the load, ensuring optimal performance.

## Key Concepts

- `Replica vs Replication Controller`: A replica is an instance of a pod, while a Replication Controller ensures a specified number of replicas are always running.
  
- `Replication Controller vs ReplicaSet`: ReplicaSet is the successor to Replication Controller, offering more advanced selector capabilities.

## Creating a Replication Controller

Let's walk through the steps of creating a Replication Controller using YAML definitions.

Define Replication Controller YAML (rc-definition.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: myapp-rc        # Name of the Replication Controller
  labels:
    app: myapp         # Labels to identify the controller
spec:
  replicas: 3           # Number of pod replicas to maintain
  selector:
    app: myapp         # Label selector to match pods controlled by this RC
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp     # Labels for pods created by this RC
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp-container   # Name of the container
          image: myapp:latest     # Docker image to use
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80   # Port exposed by the container

```

Explanation: 
```bash
    - apiVersion: Specifies the Kubernetes API version (v1 in this case) for the resource being created (ReplicationController).

    - kind: Defines the type of resource (ReplicationController).

    - metadata: Contains identifying information about the Replication Controller:

    - name: The name of the Replication Controller (myapp-rc in this example).
    - labels: Key-value pairs that identify and categorize the Replication Controller (app: myapp).
    - spec: Specifies the desired state of the Replication Controller:

        -replicas: Specifies the number of pod replicas to maintain (3 in this example).
        - selector: Defines how the Replication Controller identifies which pods it manages. Pods with labels matching the selector (app: myapp) will be controlled by this Replication Controller.
        - template: Defines the pod template used by the Replication Controller to create new pods:

            - metadata: Labels for pods created by this template (app: myapp).
            - spec: Specifies the pod specification:
            - containers: Array of containers within the pod.
            - name: Name of the container (myapp-container).
            - image: Docker image to use for the container (myapp:latest).
            - ports: List of ports exposed by the container (containerPort: 80).
```

1. `Create Replication Controller`:
   
   Run the following command to create the Replication Controller using the YAML file:
   ```yaml
   kubectl create -f rc-definition.yaml
   ```

2. `View Replication Controllers`:
   
   Check the list of Replication Controllers:
   ```yaml
   kubectl get replicationcontroller
   ```

3. `View Pods Created by Replication Controller`:
   
   Verify the pods created by the Replication Controller:
   ```yaml
   kubectl get pods
   ```
-----------

## Transition to ReplicaSet

While Replication Controllers are effective, Kubernetes recommends using ReplicaSets for more flexible management and advanced features.

## Understanding ReplicaSets

ReplicaSets are the next generation of Replication Controllers, offering enhanced capabilities such as more powerful selectors.

Define ReplicaSet YAML (rs-definition.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myapp-rs         # Name of the ReplicaSet
  labels:
    app: myapp           # Labels to identify the ReplicaSet
spec:
  replicas: 3             # Number of pod replicas to maintain
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp         # Label selector to match pods controlled by this ReplicaSet
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp       # Labels for pods created by this ReplicaSet
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp-container   # Name of the container
          image: myapp:latest     # Docker image to use
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80   # Port exposed by the container

```

Explain:

```bash
    apiVersion: Specifies the Kubernetes API version (apps/v1) for the resource being created (ReplicaSet).

    kind: Defines the type of resource (ReplicaSet).

    metadata: Contains identifying information about the ReplicaSet:

    name: The name of the ReplicaSet (myapp-rs in this example).
    labels: Key-value pairs that identify and categorize the ReplicaSet (app: myapp).
    spec: Specifies the desired state of the ReplicaSet:

    replicas: Specifies the number of pod replicas to maintain (3 in this example).
    selector: Defines how the ReplicaSet identifies which pods it manages. Pods with labels matching the selector (app: myapp) will be controlled by this ReplicaSet.
    matchLabels: Label selector to match pods (app: myapp).
    template: Defines the pod template used by the ReplicaSet to create new pods:
    metadata: Labels for pods created by this template (app: myapp).
    spec: Specifies the pod specification:
    containers: Array of containers within the pod.
    name: Name of the container (myapp-container).
    image: Docker image to use for the container (myapp:latest).
    ports: List of ports exposed by the container (containerPort: 80).
```

1. `Create ReplicaSet`:
   
   Run the following command to create the ReplicaSet using the YAML file:
   ```yaml
   kubectl create -f rs-definition.yaml
   ```

2. `View ReplicaSets`:
   
   Check the list of ReplicaSets:
   ```yaml
   kubectl get replicaset
   ```

3. `View Pods Created by ReplicaSet`:
   
   Verify the pods created by the ReplicaSet:
   ```yaml
   kubectl get pods
   ```

# Labels and Selectors

Labels and selectors play a critical role in Kubernetes for organizing and managing resources efficiently. Let's explore why they are used and how they are applied in practical scenarios.

## Importance of Labels and Selectors

Why Label Pods and Objects?

In Kubernetes, labels are key-value pairs attached to objects like pods, services, and deployments. They serve multiple purposes:

- `Identification and Grouping`: Labels allow you to identify and group related objects together. For example, you might label pods belonging to a frontend service as `app=frontend`.

- `Flexible Querying`: Kubernetes uses labels for querying and filtering objects. This is especially useful when you want to perform operations on a subset of objects that share common characteristics.

- `Resource Management`: Labels enable controllers like ReplicaSets to manage sets of pods based on predefined criteria.

## Scenario: Using ReplicaSets with Labels and Selectors

Let's consider a scenario where you have deployed three instances of a frontend web application as separate pods. Now, you want to ensure that these pods are always running, even if one or more of them fail.

`Role of ReplicaSets:`

- `Continuous Monitoring`: ReplicaSets are designed to monitor pods and maintain a specified number of replicas (pods) at all times.
  
- `Automatic Recovery`: If a pod managed by a ReplicaSet fails, the ReplicaSet automatically creates a new pod to replace it, ensuring the desired number of replicas is maintained.

`How ReplicaSets Use Labels and Selectors:`

To instruct a ReplicaSet on which pods to manage, you define a selector in its specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: frontend-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: frontend-container
          image: frontend-image:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

Explanation:
  - `selector`: Specifies which pods the ReplicaSet should manage based on labels. Here, it selects pods with the label `app=frontend`.
  
  - `template`: Defines the pod template used by the ReplicaSet to create new pods or replace failed ones. It includes the pod's metadata (including labels) and specifications (such as containers).

## When to Provide a Template Section

You might wonder if you need to specify a template section if you already have existing pods that match the selector criteria:

- `Scenario`: Suppose you already have three existing pods labeled `app=frontend` and you create a ReplicaSet to ensure these pods are always running.

- `Do you need a template section?`: Yes, even if all required pods already exist. The template section is essential because it defines how new pods will be created to replace any that may fail in the future.

- `Future-Proofing`: Providing a template ensures that the ReplicaSet can maintain the desired number of pods regardless of their current state, whether creating new pods or replacing failed ones.

### Conclusion

Labels and selectors are fundamental concepts in Kubernetes that enable efficient management and operation of applications. They allow controllers like ReplicaSets to dynamically manage pods based on criteria you define, ensuring reliability and scalability.

By understanding how labels and selectors work, you gain greater control over your Kubernetes deployments, making them more resilient and easier to manage.

# Scaling the ReplicaSet

Scaling a ReplicaSet allows you to adjust the number of pod replicas it manages, which can be crucial for handling varying loads or ensuring redundancy.

## Methods to Scale a ReplicaSet

### Method 1: Update and Replace Command

1. `Update the ReplicaSet Definition File`: Modify the `spec.replicas` field in your ReplicaSet definition file to the desired number of replicas (e.g., 6).

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: ReplicaSet
   metadata:
     name: frontend-rs
   spec:
     replicas: 6  # Update this number to 6
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: frontend
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: frontend
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: frontend-container
             image: frontend-image:latest
             ports:
               - containerPort: 80
   ```

2. `Apply the Changes`: Use the `kubectl replace` command to apply the updated ReplicaSet definition file.

   ```bash
   kubectl replace -f frontend-rs.yaml
   ```

   - This command updates the ReplicaSet to have 6 replicas based on the modified definition file (`frontend-rs.yaml`).

-----

### Method 2: Scale Command

1. `Scale Using Command`: Directly scale the ReplicaSet using the `kubectl scale` command.

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=6 replicaset/frontend-rs
```

   - This command scales the existing ReplicaSet named `frontend-rs` to 6 replicas.

   - You can specify the number of replicas (`--replicas=6`) directly in the command without modifying the file.

   - Ensure to replace `frontend-rs` with the actual name of your ReplicaSet.

### Explanation

- `Updating Definition File`: Modifying the `spec.replicas` field in the ReplicaSet definition file sets the desired number of replicas permanently. When you apply (`kubectl replace`) the updated file, Kubernetes reconciles the state to match the specified number of replicas.

- `Scaling via Command`: Using `kubectl scale` provides a quick way to adjust the number of replicas without modifying the definition file. This command directly updates the ReplicaSet's desired number of replicas in the Kubernetes control plane.

- `Automatic File Update`: Note that scaling via `kubectl scale` does not automatically update the ReplicaSet definition file (`frontend-rs.yaml`). The file remains unchanged unless manually updated.

### Additional Commands Overview

- `Create`: Use `kubectl create -f file.yaml` to create a ReplicaSet (or any Kubernetes object) from a definition file (`file.yaml`).

- `Get`: View details of created ReplicaSets with `kubectl get replicaset`.

- `Delete`: Remove a ReplicaSet and its associated pods using `kubectl delete replicaset frontend-rs`.

### Conclusion

Scaling a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes involves updating the `replicas` field in its definition file or using the `kubectl scale` command. These methods provide flexibility in managing pod instances to meet application demands efficiently.

IMP:

The kubectl edit command is quite useful in Kubernetes as it allows you to directly edit the YAML definition of a resource using the default text editor configured in your environment (typically vi or vim). Here's how you would use it specifically with a ReplicaSet:

`kubectl edit replicaset replicaset-name`
