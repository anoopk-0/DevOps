# Understanding Network Policies in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, **network policies** are crucial for controlling the flow of traffic between pods within the cluster. They enable fine-grained control over ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic based on defined rules.

## Basic Concept Recap:

1. **Pod Communication in Kubernetes:**
   - By default, all pods in a Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each other. This unrestricted communication is due to Kubernetes being configured with an "All Allow" rule, allowing traffic from any pod to any other pod or service within the cluster.

2. **Traffic Flow Example:**
   - Consider a simple application setup:
     - A front-end web server pod (`web-pod`) communicates with an API server pod (`api-pod`) and a database server pod (`db-pod`).
     - Traffic flow: User -> Web Server (port 80) -> API Server (port 5000) -> Database Server (port 3306).

3. **Need for Network Policies:**
   - Sometimes, it's necessary to restrict direct communication between certain pods for security reasons. For example, the security team might require that only the API server pod can communicate with the database server pod, while the web server pod should not have direct access to the database.

## Implementing a Network Policy:

Let's create a network policy (`db-policy`) to enforce the restriction that only the API server pod can communicate with the database server pod (`db-pod`) on port 3306.

**Step 1: Define the Network Policy**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

**Explanation:**
- `apiVersion`: Specifies the Kubernetes API version for NetworkPolicy.
- `kind`: Specifies the type of resource, which is NetworkPolicy.
- `metadata`: Includes metadata like the name of the network policy.
- `spec`: Defines the specification for the network policy.
  - `podSelector`: Selects the target pods (`db-pod`) to which this policy applies based on labels (`app: db`).
  - `policyTypes`: Specifies the type of policy, in this case, only `Ingress` (incoming traffic) is defined.
  - `ingress`: Defines rules for incoming traffic.
    - `from`: Specifies the source of the traffic.
      - `podSelector`: Selects the source pods (`api-pod`) based on labels (`app: api`).
    - `ports`: Specifies the ports and protocols allowed for incoming traffic.
      - `protocol`: Specifies the protocol (TCP in this case).
      - `port`: Specifies the port number (3306 for MySQL).

**Step 2: Applying the Network Policy**

Apply the network policy using the `kubectl apply` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f db-policy.yaml
```

This command deploys the network policy defined in `db-policy.yaml` to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Considerations:

- **Policy Enforcement:** Network policies are enforced by the network solution (CNI plugin) running in the Kubernetes cluster. Not all CNIs support network policies; for example, Flannel does not support network policies.
- **Effect of Policy Types:** If only `Ingress` is specified under `policyTypes`, only incoming traffic is restricted. Egress traffic remains unrestricted unless explicitly defined.

## Conclusion:

Network policies in Kubernetes provide essential control over pod-to-pod communication within the cluster. By defining and applying specific rules, administrators can enforce security policies and isolate workloads effectively. Understanding and correctly implementing network policies is crucial for maintaining a secure Kubernetes environment.

# Understanding Network Policies in Kubernetes

Network policies in Kubernetes allow you to define rules that control the flow of network traffic to and from pods. These policies are crucial for enforcing security and access controls within your cluster.

#### Scenario Overview

In our example, we have three pods:
- **Web Pod**: Serving frontend to users.
- **API Pod**: Serving backend APIs.
- **Database Pod**: Hosting the application's database.

Our goal is to restrict access to the **Database Pod** so that only the **API Pod** can communicate with it on port 3306. All other pods can have unrestricted communication.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation and Examples

##### 1. Defining a Network Policy for Database Pod

**Objective:** Block all traffic to the Database Pod except from the API Pod on port 3306.

**Network Policy Definition (`db-policy.yaml`):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: database
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

**Explanation:**
- `podSelector`: Selects the Database Pod based on labels (`app: database`).
- `policyTypes`: Specifies that this policy is for ingress traffic only.
- `ingress`: Defines rules for incoming traffic.
  - `from`: Specifies the source of the traffic.
    - `podSelector`: Selects the source pods (`app: api`) allowed to communicate with the Database Pod.
  - `ports`: Specifies the ports and protocols allowed for incoming traffic (TCP on port 3306).

**Diagram:**
```
                          +---------------------+
                          |     Web Pod         |
                          |    (app: web)       |
                          +---------------------+
                                 | (ingress)
                                 v
                          +---------------------+
                          |      API Pod        |
                          |    (app: api)       |
                          +---------------------+
                                 | (egress)
                                 v
                          +---------------------+
                          |   Database Pod      |
                          |  (app: database)    |
                          +---------------------+
```
- **Web Pod**: Allows all ingress/egress traffic.
- **API Pod**: Allowed to ingress traffic to Database Pod on port 3306.
- **Database Pod**: Only allows ingress traffic from API Pod on port 3306.

##### 2. Handling Multiple API Pods and Different Namespaces

**Objective:** Restrict access to the Database Pod to only the API Pod in the `prod` namespace.

**Enhanced Network Policy (`db-policy.yaml`):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: database
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          environment: prod
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

**Explanation:**
- `namespaceSelector`: Ensures that only pods from namespaces labeled `environment: prod` can communicate with the Database Pod.
- `podSelector`: Further restricts to only API Pods (`app: api`) within the `prod` namespace.

**Diagram:**
```
                      +---------------------+
                      |     Web Pod         |
                      |    (app: web)       |
                      +---------------------+
                             | (ingress)
                             v
                      +---------------------+
                      |      API Pod        |
                      |  (app: api,          |
                      |   environment: prod) |
                      +---------------------+
                             | (egress)
                             v
                      +---------------------+
                      |   Database Pod      |
                      |  (app: database)    |
                      +---------------------+
```
- **Web Pod**: No restrictions.
- **API Pod (prod)**: Allowed to ingress traffic to Database Pod on port 3306.
- **Database Pod**: Only allows ingress traffic from API Pod in `prod` namespace on port 3306.

##### 3. Allowing Egress Traffic from Database Pod

**Objective:** Allow Database Pod to initiate egress traffic to an external backup server.

**Network Policy with Egress (`db-policy.yaml`):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: database
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          environment: prod
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 192.168.5.10/32
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

**Explanation:**
- `egress`: Defines rules for outgoing traffic from the Database Pod.
  - `to`: Specifies the destination of the traffic.
    - `ipBlock`: Allows traffic to a specific IP address range (`192.168.5.10/32`).
  - `ports`: Specifies the ports and protocols allowed for outgoing traffic (TCP on port 80).

**Diagram:**
```
                          +---------------------+
                          |     Web Pod         |
                          |    (app: web)       |
                          +---------------------+
                                 | (ingress)
                                 v
                          +---------------------+
                          |      API Pod        |
                          |  (app: api,         |
                          |   environment: prod)|
                          +---------------------+
                                 | (egress)
                                 v
                          +---------------------+
                          |   Database Pod      |
                          |  (app: database)    |
                          +---------------------+
                                   | (egress)
                                   v
                          +---------------------+
                          |  External Backup    |
                          |  Server             |
                          |  (192.168.5.10)     |
                          +---------------------+
```
- **Web Pod**: No restrictions.
- **API Pod (prod)**: Allowed to ingress traffic to Database Pod on port 3306.
- **Database Pod**: Allowed egress traffic to External Backup Server (`192.168.5.10`) on port 80.

### Conclusion
