# Understanding Kubernetes Storage Classes

1. Static Provisioning vs Dynamic Provisioning:

      - Static Provisioning: Traditionally, with Kubernetes, you had to manually create PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). This involved pre-provisioning storage resources (like disks on cloud providers) and then creating PV definitions manually.
        
      - Dynamic Provisioning: Storage classes enable dynamic provisioning, where storage resources are automatically provisioned when a PVC claims storage. This simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual PV creation.

2. What is a Storage Class?

A Storage Class in Kubernetes provides a way to describe different "classes" of storage, which have different capabilities and properties. Each Storage Class specifies a provisioner (like a cloud provider's storage service) that Kubernetes uses to dynamically provision storage when a PVC using that Storage Class is created.

3. Example Scenario:

Let's consider an example where we want to use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to dynamically provision storage for our Kubernetes cluster.

### Example Walkthrough

Step 1: Define a Storage Class

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: standard
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd  # Provisioner for GCP PD
parameters:
  type: pd-standard  # Type of disk (Standard persistent disk)
```

Explanation:
- This YAML defines a Storage Class named `standard` for GCP.
- `provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd` specifies that Kubernetes should use the GCP Persistent Disk (PD) provisioner.
- `parameters` section allows you to specify parameters specific to the provisioner. For GCP PD, `type: pd-standard` specifies a standard persistent disk.

Step 2: Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: standard  # Use the storage class defined above
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi  # Requesting 10 GiB of storage
```

Explanation:
- This PVC requests storage using the `standard` Storage Class.
- `accessModes` specifies how the volume can be accessed (e.g., `ReadWriteOnce` for single node read-write access).
- `resources.requests.storage` specifies the size of the storage needed.

Step 3: Diagram Illustration

In the diagram:
- Storage Class (`standard`): Describes the provisioner and parameters for dynamically provisioning storage on GCP.
- PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC): Requests storage using the `standard` Storage Class. When created, it triggers the provisioner to dynamically create a GCP PD of 10 GiB (as requested).
- PersistentVolume (PV): Created automatically by Kubernetes using the provisioned GCP PD. It binds to the PVC, making the storage available to pods.
- Pod: Uses the PVC as a volume mount, accessing the dynamically provisioned storage.

### Summary

- Storage Classes in Kubernetes automate the provisioning of storage resources based on defined classes and policies.
- They eliminate the need for manual PV creation and streamline the deployment of applications requiring storage.
- Each cloud provider (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure) typically has its own provisioner which can be used in Kubernetes via Storage Classes.

By leveraging Storage Classes, Kubernetes provides a powerful mechanism for managing storage dynamically, improving automation and flexibility in cloud-native applications.
